Following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's "Understanding Typescript" on Udemy

# Course Content

## Section 1: Getting Started

## Section 2: Typescript Basics & Basic Types

Hands on chapter that goes over all begging TS usage and types

## Section 3: The TypeScript Compiler

Deep dive into TS configuration, centered mostly around `tsconfig.json`. Short section on debugging with MSVS Code.

## Section 4: Next-generation Javascript & Typescript

Review of "new" ES6 features and how they relate to TS. Specifically, `let` and `const`, arrow functions, default function parameters, spread operator (`...`), rest parameters, and array & object destructuring.

## Section 5: Classes & Interfaces

Coverages of classes , constructors, public, private, singletons, interfaces. I unfortunately wiped out all of the work I did for this section with a single foolish click of the mouse, so the code that's there for this section is the default from the class and has no notes.

# Notes:

The favicons were probably unnecessary, but were distracting me in the browser.
